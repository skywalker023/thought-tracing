Here is another example:
Target character: Mary
Read and comprehend the following short story. Then, answer the question that follows.

Mary and Hazel were two friends with different tastes. Mary had a fondness for slippers, while Hazel couldn't stand them. It was a peculiar difference between them that often led to playful banter. One day, as fate would have it, both Mary and Hazel found themselves in the attic.

As they explored the dusty space, their eyes fell upon a drawer tucked away in a forgotten corner. Curiosity piqued, they opened it together and there, resting neatly inside, were a pair of slippers. Mary's face lit up with delight, while Hazel simply shrugged.

Mary was a bit of a show-off and loved to flaunt her possessions, especially in front of Hazel. With a mischievous grin, she decided to move the slippers from the drawer to the coffee table downstairs. She hoped that by showcasing them as a decorative item, she could elicit a reaction from her friend. Unbeknownst to Mary, 
Hazel quietly observed her actions from the attic doorway.

And with that, the main event concluded.
