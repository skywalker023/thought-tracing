For each sentence in a given text, indicate whether it includes an action or utterance directly from the target character. If the sentence describes an action performed by the target character, add <action> at the end. If the sentence only describes the character's thoughts, desires, intentions, or emotions, or if the action is performed by a different character, add <no action> instead.

Here is an example:
Target character: Nadia
Answer the questions based on the context. Keep your answer concise, few words are enough, maximum one sentence. Answer as 'Answer:<option>)<answer>'.

Story: Nadia is a professional gardener, working on a landscape design for a client's backyard. She wants to plant a beautiful rose garden as the centerpiece of the design. Nadia observes that the soil in the backyard appears to be rich and fertile. However, a heavy rainstorm occurs overnight, washing away many nutrients and leaving the soil less fertile. Nadia proceeds with planting the rose garden in the existing soil.
Question: Does Nadia believe the soil is rich and fertile or less fertile after the rainstorm?

Output:
